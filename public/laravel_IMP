*************to dowmnload files >>>>>>>php artisan storage:link*******************

By default Laravel puts files in the storage/app/public directory, 
which is not accessible from the outside web. 
So you have to create a symbolic link between that directory and your public one:
storage/app/public -> public/storage
You can do that by executing the php artisan storage:link
